    <textOnly>Thank you for submitting your support request online. Case #: {!Case.CaseNumber}: &quot;{!Case.Subject}&quot; has been created and you will be notified when an IPro Media Support Representative begins work on your case. Our Service Level Response goals are as follows:


Priority 1: 4 Business Hours (Outage to your IPro Service affecting critical business function or 50% of the service)

NOTE: If you have a Priority 1 case, please call in to (903) 482-8110 to have your case escalated.  Email is not a real time communication method and should not be used for Priority 1 outages.

Priority 2: 8 Business Hours (Outage less than P1 level, but significant business impact or high visibility personnel)

Priority 3: 3 Business Days (Non-outage services requests and changes, or small outages of individual devices)

Priority 4: 5 Business Days (Project work, large scale service requests or changes)


Support for your IPro Services are available during all regular business hours for non-business critical cases.  Support is available during extended hours for critical failures. All times listed are in Central Standard Time.

Regular support hours: Monday - Friday, 8:00 AM-5:00 PM

Extended support hours: 7 days per week excluding holidays, 6:00 AM-10:00 PM


The first weekend of every month is reserved for system
maintenance from Saturday night at 10pm through Sunday evening at 10pm for changes that may potentially impact the availability of the IPro Service.  Please contact us 2 weeks in advance of schedule maintenance windows if you need to have your services excluded from certain maintenance windows.


Thank You
