    <defaultValue>"Make sure you have selected the correct contact based on service/delivery location. Best Practice would be to associate the contact to the account, prior to creating the sales order.  If you need the product/service to arrive at another location, overwrite the shipping address information as needed to ensure proper delivery.     Once you have selected a DELIVERY CONTACT, and you wish to overwrite the SHIPPING ADDRESS on the sales order, click the new button at the top labeled, [Update Address]."</defaultValue>
